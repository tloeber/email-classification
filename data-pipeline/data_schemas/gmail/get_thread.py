"""
This package defines the schemas for the data that we expect to receive from
the Gmail API. These schemas are used by Pydantic to parse the data, and to
raise an exception if the data cannot be coereced into the respective schema.

API Documentation:
https://googleapis.github.io/google-api-python-client/docs/dyn/gmail_v1.users.threads.html

This specific module defines all schemas for *getting* a particular thread.

Note that these classes are data structures, not `real` classes: They expose
their data, rather than exposing behavior while encapsulating data. (The
behavior is defined in the `email_domain` package, and is decoupled from the
data schemas that particular email APIs use.)

The order of class definitions is significant: Start with innermost data
classes! Otherwise, Pydantic raises an error (though it may still  be
possible to make it work by explicitly updating forward references.

# Due to the large number of inner data classes - which result from the nesting

    Even though this is a data structure rather than a proper class, I still
    decided to implement custom getter logic here. Rationale:
    - These methods do not fit into the domain representation
      (email_domain.Message) because they may differ between email APIs, rather
      than being a characteristic of our domain.
    - While we could introduce another class that parses raw Gmail messages, at
      this point it does not seem worth the extra complexity that this would
